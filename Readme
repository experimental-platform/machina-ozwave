install go-openzwave:

follow the instructions in their readme but `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` before running make deps
after running make deps: `cd openzwave; sudo make install`

if go run fails with "libopenzwave.so.1.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/local/lib64
